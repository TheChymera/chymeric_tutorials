The static site generator [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) is surrounded by a large community which has [generated a large variety of themes](https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes) for it.
Many developers use actual blogs as theme previews, which - as Octopress bloggers are avid hackers - contain many customizations.
Thus, users (newer ones in particular) are oft disappointed by the unexpectedly low amount of chrome they see on their website upon deployment of the default theme.
Some developers instead keep an empty demo site with the default theme - a passable solution - which, however, takes up a lot of time (due to the need to update both Octopress and the theme manually on yet another site).

To make maintaining true-to-the-default demos easier for developers, we present *Theme-Space* - a GitHub-based repository for Octopress theme previews.
