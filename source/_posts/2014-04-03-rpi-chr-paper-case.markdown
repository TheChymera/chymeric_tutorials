The [Raspberry Pi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_pi) (often referred to in shorthand as RPi) is a credit-card size single-board computer very popular with the [DIY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself) and hacker communities.
As such, while there are a number of commercial cases for the Raspberry Pi, users often prefer to instead invest a bit of time in making their own.

Based on the initial idea of the [Punnet case](http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=6424), we have designed the **RPi Chr paper case**, an improved version, with:

* Ports at the correct positions.
* A thinner SD card slit.
* A reduction in height (many paper cases are unnecessarily tall).
* A tighter overall fit (8.8cm X 5.7cm X 2.5cm).
* Streamlined vent slits.

Additionally to the **[PDF](http://chymera.eu/res/RPi_chr_paper_case.pdf)**, we provide an easily-editable **[SVG file](http://chymera.eu/res/RPi_chr_paper_case.svg)** for happy hacking.
The ```.svg``` file is cleanly set-up, with all lines as independent paths, and all at a thickness of 0.25mm.
We use “Sans” for all text to ensure legibility on all systems.

Here are a couple of shots of the Chymeric Paper Case in action.
You will note the absence of vent etchings;
while our case blueprint provides them for people thus inclined, we have yet to run into trouble because of their absence.
In fact, the Pi is designed from elements made to function with no air flow whatsoever (check out [this forum thread](http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=49340) for more information).
