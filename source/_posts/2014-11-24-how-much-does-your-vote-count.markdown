Whether or not your vote matters in large elections is a tendentious question, to which political groups give tendentious answers.
Since democracy draws its authority from votes, there is a broad, semi-honest consensus in political propaganda that *your vote matters* - which aims to influence rather than inform and educate.

Here we detail why the question is ill posed, and offer a phrasing more conducive to an accurate answer: “*what is the probability* that your vote matters?”
We review a common method of answering this question from the relevant scientific literature, and offer up a vastly improved formula and link to a [free and open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) script, which makes that formula broadly accessible.
Lastly we discuss how this formula could be used by politicians and political scientists, and - to satisfy the stubborn reader - answer the original question (“does my vote matter?”) within a rounding error, with a clear **no**.
