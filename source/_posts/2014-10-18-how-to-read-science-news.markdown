Nowadays, popular science (pop-science) is no topic to overlook on social media.
Websites or groups such as 8fact, ScienceIsAwesome, and IFuckingLoveScience easily collect millions of likes and receive a high number of re-shares on their content.
In parallel, more traditional popular science outlets - such as Wired Magazine or Discover Magazine - also continue to attract a large readership and also have a vast outreach on social networks. 
The scientific readership routinely recognizes pop-science reporting as inaccurate, misleading, or even outright wrong.
Oblivious to most science reporters' lack of insight, however, laymen may instead wonder: 
*Why does technology not deliver upon the promises made by pop-science?*
or *Why are pop-science reports so inconsistent with each other?* 
The answer to both questions is plainly *very bad journalism*; but, instead of reflecting badly on its authors, sub-par pop-science content undermines the credibility of science: by creating either the impression that science overreaches and cannot deliver, or that there is gross disagreement in the scientific community - even when there is little.

We assume that this incorrect appraisal of science is based on a series of misconceptions about what science news actually constitute, and we present a brief theoretical explanation of how one should best contextualize science journalism.

##Who Writes Pop-Science?

Contrary to many a layman's impression, pop-science is seldom written by actual scientists. 
Admittedly, a very small number of science journalists might sport an undergraduate degree in some science subject - but, while this may be used to leverage extra credibility, a BSc. does not a scientist make.
In most universities it is entirely possible if not common to coast through Master's or Bachelor's courses without ever being up-to-date with primary scientific literature.
Beyond just that, those who choose to turn their career away from research after completing an MSc. or even just a BSc. are rarely those who put significant effort into grasping primary research.
To put science journalists' own credibility into perspective: as a rule of thumb, they are only marginally more educated on the subject matter than the average college graduate.

##Why Does One Write Pop-Science?

The chief claim of most pop-science authors is that they want to educate the public on the wonders of science.
To be sure, there are many science educators out there: 
they work in schools, universities, and some even on the internet (teaching basic principles of science on YouTube, or answering questions on [StackExchange](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Exchange)).
What these science educators have in common is that they package information in a teaching-friendly format: starting with their target demographic's basics and working up from there.
Journalism, however, does not fit this format.
Knowingly or otherwise, science journalists undermine science education, and instead mangle science reporting to fit their need to communicate:

### Science as the dancing monkey
A more accurate reason to write pop-science is in fact hidden in the the philanthropic canonical claim mentioned above: “the wonders of science”.
That is what many science journalists actually want to sell.
Such science reporters try to reformat (or re-imagine) scientific discoveries so that they sound awe-inspiring but do not require much preexisting education to grasp.
Needless to say, this is a format which actual research often refuses to conform with.

### Science as the Pope
Other science journalists may choose to also (or rather) reap the credibility of science.
Opinion pieces can easily become more authoritative if they are disguised as science news; and people are easier to rally to a cause if they believe it is a logical response to objective evidence.
This motivation behind science journalism is most clearly seen with politically controversial issues, such as [global warming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming_controversy) or [GMO-related risks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_food_controversies).
The strong agreement of the scientific community on these issues (plainly: global warming *is* happening, and GMOs *are not* dangerous) is obscured to consumers of pop-science, precisely because many science journalists use selectively reported research to license a political agenda. 

##Where do Science News Come from?
Expectedly, science news originate with scientists.
Members of the scientific community publish new findings in [scientific journals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_journal).
The reasons why the public does not directly read scientific reports are as manifold, but mainly rooted in primary research being too difficult to understand and it being unavailable to the public in the first place (the latter of these two phenomena duly combated by the [open access movement](http://whoneedsaccess.org/)).
One of the main 

##Why Does One Read Pop-Science?

The reasons to read pop-science fall very well into the pattern given by the reasons to write it.
People do not seek out pop-science for understanding, they seek it for the thrill of awe-inspiring factoids or for moral guidance (or worse, support) on heated issues.
