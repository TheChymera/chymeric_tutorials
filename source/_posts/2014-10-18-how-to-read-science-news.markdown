Pop-science is currently no topic to overlook on social media.
Websites or groups such as 8fact or IFLScience easily collect millions of likes and receive a high number of re-shares on their content.
In parallel, more traditional outlets - such as Wired Magazine or Discover Magazine - also continue to attract a large readership and have a vast outreach on social networks.
The scientific readership routinely recognizes pop-science reporting as inaccurate, misleading, or even outright wrong.
Oblivious to most science reporters' lack of insight, however, laymen may instead wonder:
*Why does technology not deliver upon the promises made by pop-science?*
or *Why are pop-science reports so inconsistent?*
The answer to both questions is plainly: **very bad journalism**.
However, instead of reflecting badly on its authors, sub-par pop-science undermines the credibility of research: creating either the impression that science overreaches and cannot deliver, or that there is gross disagreement in the scientific community - even when there is little.

We assume that this incorrect appraisal of science is based on a series of misconceptions about what science news actually constitute, and we present a brief theoretical explanation of how one should best contextualize science journalism.

##Who Writes Pop-Science?

Contrary to many a layman's impression, pop-science is seldom written by actual scientists, with any specialized knowledge pertaining to the field at hand.
Admittedly, a very small number of science journalists might sport an undergraduate degree in some science subject - but, while this may be used to leverage extra credibility, a BSc. does not a scientist make.
It is entirely possible if not common to coast through Master's or Bachelor's courses without ever being up-to-date with primary scientific literature
- and certainly without acquiring the skills needed to critically report on it.
In addition to that, those who choose to turn their career towards journalism and away from research after completing an MSc. or even just a BSc. are rarely those ready to put significant effort into grasping primary research.

To put science journalists' personal credibility into perspective: as a rule of thumb, they are only marginally more educated on the subject matter than the average college graduate.
Consequently, their writing should never be taken at face value in the absence of corroborating references.

##Why Does One Write Pop-Science?

The chief claim of most pop-science authors is that they want to educate the public on the wonders of science.
To be sure, there are many science educators out there:
they work in schools, universities, and on the internet (teaching basic principles of science on YouTube, or answering questions on [StackExchange](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Exchange)).
What these science educators have in common is that they package information in a teaching-friendly format: starting with their target demographic's basics and working up from there.
Journalism, however, does not fit this format.
Knowingly or otherwise, science journalists undermine science education, and instead mangle research data to fit their communication needs:

### Science as the dancing monkey
A more veracious reason to write pop-science is in fact hidden in the the claim mentioned above - “the wonders of science”.
That is what many science journalists actually want to sell.
Such science reporters try to reformat (or re-imagine) scientific discoveries so that they sound awe-inspiring but do not require any education to grasp.
Needless to say, science seldom fits this format, and one should be weary of reports in which current research seems to conform with it.

### Science as the Pope
Other science journalists may choose to also (or rather) market the *credibility* of science.
Opinion pieces can easily become more authoritative if they are disguised as science news; and people are easier to rally to a cause if they can be convinced it is a logical response to objective evidence.
This motivation is most clearly seen with politically controversial issues, such as [global warming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming_controversy) or [GMO-related risks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_food_controversies).
The strong agreement of the scientific community on both these issues (plainly: [global warming *is* happening](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change), and [GMOs *are not* dangerous](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2408621/) - also see sources [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_food_controversies) for the latter) is obscured to consumers of pop-science, precisely because many science journalists use selectively reported research to license a political agenda.

##Where do Science News Come from?
Unsurprisingly, science news originate with scientists.
Members of the scientific community publish new findings in specialized periodicals called [scientific journals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_journal).
The main reasons why the public does not directly read scientific journals are primary research being somewhat difficult to understand and it being unavailable to the public (the latter of these two phenomena duly combated by the [open access movement](http://whoneedsaccess.org/)).

One of the many detrimental effects of closed-circuit publishing (as still seen in most scientific journals), is that journalists are generally certain to not have read about the *actual* research.
To add insult to injury, this same system also prevents the public from verifying whether the reporting is truthful - thus hindering a factual review of science journalism's quality.



##Why Does One Read Pop-Science?

The reasons to read pop-science fall very well into the pattern given by the reasons to write it.
People do not seek out pop-science for understanding, they seek it for the thrill of awe-inspiring factoids or for moral guidance (or worse, support) on heated issues.
