Pop-sciencee is currently no topic to overlook on social media.
Websites or groups such as 8fact or IFLScience easily collect millions of likes and receive a high number of re-shares on their content.
In parallel, pop-science magazines also continue to attract many readers and have a vast outreach on social networks.
The scientific readership routinely recognizes pop-science reporting as inaccurate, misleading, or even outright wrong.
Oblivious to most science reporters' lack of insight, however, laymen may instead wonder:
*Why does technology not deliver upon the promises made by pop-science?*
or *Why are pop-science reports so inconsistent?*
The answer to both questions is plainly: **very bad journalism**.
However, instead of reflecting badly on its authors, sub-par pop-science undermines the credibility of research: creating either the impression that science overreaches and cannot deliver, or that there is gross disagreement in the scientific community - even when there is little.

We assume that this incorrect appraisal is based on a series of misconceptions about what science news actually constitute, and we present a brief theoretical explanation of how one should best contextualize science journalism.

##Disclaimer
Without doubt, there are rare and exemplary exceptions to the trends detailed below.
Some scientists do in fact dedicate part of their time to personally report in an easily-understandable language on their own and their colleagues' work.
Also, some former science students or autodidacts may actually understand and link to primary reports when writing an article.
We are proud to explicitly name some of these exceptions (when naming authors, not necessarily recommending their publishers):

* **Authors:** [Neuroskeptic](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/)
* **Networks:** [physicsfocus](http://physicsfocus.org/),

##Who Writes Pop-Science?

Contrary to many a layman's impression, pop-science is seldom written by actual scientists or by people somehow affiliated to research.
Admittedly, a very small number of science journalists may try to levrage extra credibility with some science degree obtained at some point in their lives, but alas, a BSc. does not a scientist make (and certainly not the brand of scientist who can report on topics across the board).
It is entirely possible, if not common, to coast through Master's or Bachelor's courses without ever being up-to-date with primary scientific literature
- and certainly without acquiring the skills needed to critically report on it.

To put science journalists' personal credibility into perspective: as a rule of thumb, there is little reason to assume that they are more educated on the subject matter than the average college graduate.
Consequently, their writing should *never* be taken at face value in the absence of corroborating references.

##Why Does One Write Pop-Science?

The chief claim of pop-science authors is that they want to educate the public on the wonders of science.
To be sure, there are many science educators out there:
working in schools, universities, and even on the internet (teaching basic principles of science on YouTube, or answering questions on [StackExchange](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Exchange)).
What these science educators have in common is that they package information in a teaching-friendly format: starting with their target demographic's basics and working up from there.
Journalism, typically, does not fit this format.
Knowingly or otherwise, science journalists undermine science education, and instead mangle research reporting to fit their dissenting requirements:

### Science as the Dancing Monkey
A more veracious motivational statement is in fact hidden in the the claim mentioned above -
“the wonders of science”; that is what many science journalists actually want to sell.
In doing so, they reformat (or re-imagine) scientific discoveries according to a formula more closely resembling sci-fi than science education:
high entertainment value, no prerequisites.
Sadly, current research seldom conforms to this format;
and sacrificing insight to better deliver awe-inspiring reports leaves readers oblivious to crucial limitations of [primary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_research)/[secondary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_research) research, research tools, and the [scientific method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method).
This incites both inappropriate expectations, and wild speculation as to why they are not being met - ranging from conspiracy theories to distrust in scientists' capabilities, but somehow omitting distrust for the actual reporter.

### Science as the Pope
Other science journalists may choose to also (or rather) market the *credibility* of science.
Opinion pieces can easily become more authoritative if they are disguised as science news; and people are easier to rally to a cause if they can be convinced it is a logical response to objective evidence.
This motivation is most clearly seen with politically controversial issues, such as [global warming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming_controversy) or [GMO-related risks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_food_controversies).
The strong agreement of the scientific community on both these issues (plainly: [global warming *is* happening](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change), and [GMOs *are not* dangerous](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2408621/) - also see sources [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_food_controversies) for the latter) is obscured to consumers of pop-science, precisely because many science journalists use selectively reported research to license a political agenda.

##Where do Science News Come from?
Unsurprisingly, science news originate with scientists.
Members of the scientific community publish new findings in specialized periodicals called [scientific journals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_journal).
The reasons why the public does not directly read these journals are twofold: the articles are often laden with difficult jargon, and most of these articles are in fact inaccessible to the public in the first place (the latter of these two phenomena being duly combated by the [open access movement](http://whoneedsaccess.org/)).

One of the many detrimental effects of such closed-circuit publishing is that *both* journalists *and* the broad public are certain to not be able to read the actual research.
Thus forms an abstruse system that *both* precludes journalistic competence and transparency *and* hinders public review.
In practice this translates into two licenses for pop-science journalists:

* To sell reporting which is not theirs (*in the best of cases science news is reporting on reporting* )
* To distort and to fabricate (*who **would** check the facts? who **could** check the facts?* )

While cases where journalists completely fabricate a scientific finding are not unheard of, most often they base their reporting on any of the following sources of information:

* Interviews (needless to say - very rarely)
* Emails sent to researchers to ask for clarification (duly portrayed as interviews in their writing: “*lead researcher NAME tells MAGAZINE ...*”)
* [Press releases](http://www.scidev.net/global/communication/editorials/press-releases-may-be-tempting-but-they-miss-the-wider-picture.html) from universities or institutes
* Abstracts openly published by scientific journals
* Other tangential pop-science articles
* Imagination or vague recollection

So, while you might believe that science journalists translate dense information from primary sources while keeping things accurate for your convenience; the science news you actually read are but superficially (and perhaps repeatedly) rehashed summaries of reports simplified elsewhere by other people.
Among many other side effects, such repeated simplification by people other than the reader and the writer leaves them in the dark on what and why information was left out, and soundly unable to draw any pertinent conclusions in the article or based on the article.

##Why Does One Read Pop-Science?

It would be folly to assume that the sorry state of popular science arises solely from journalists selling sub-par content to people who want something else entirely.
While it is debatable whether the offer gave rise to the supply, or vice-versa, the reasons to read pop-science fall very well into the pattern given by the reasons to write it.

People do not seek out pop-science for understanding, they seek it for the thrill of awe-inspiring factoids or for moral guidance (or worse, support) on heated issues.
So perhaps just as crucial in the appraisal of science news as being critical of the journalist's credibility is being critical of one's own motivation to read it.

Readers who seek entertainment should best be aware that more often than not that is what pop-science offers them:
Brief entertainment, which is best not taken to heart as veritable fact after the reading is done.

Readers who seek to be informed on the developments of science, might best look to obtain a very clear picture of the respective research field elsewhere - from secondary and [tertiary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_source) sources, including Wikipedia.
Only having a clear picture of current research can one deal with and interpret others' unclear writing (at which point that writing seizes to be informative, but can become telling with regard to the author or publisher).

Lastly, as a reader in search for moral guidance on heated issues, it is best to remember that science is by definition amoral.
While the natural sciences continue to expand and to corner the metaphysical, and while our questions become more and more rooted in the physical, most controversies still exceed the grasp of (natural) science.
